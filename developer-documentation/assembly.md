# Assembly

The assembly of a new vault is carried out by the user through the platform user interface.

The starting price of the vault share (1e18 vault tokens) in a new vault is always $1.

There cannot be identical vaults in the system; each created vault can only be unique. The number of vaults that can be created depends on the availability of developed strategies, possible parameters of the strategies, farms, limits on buy-back tokens and which vaults have already been created.

To create any vault, you need ecosystem tokens, and to create a rewarding vault, you also need initial boost rewards.

After creating a vault, you receive a VaultManager NFT, which can be used to receive a portion of the platform's income and manage the parameters of managed vaults and strategies.
