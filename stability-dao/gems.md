# Sonic Gems

> Sonic Gems are developer-focused airdrop points designed to reward apps for driving user engagement and innovation. These Gems can be redeemed for S tokens, which apps can then distribute as rewards to their users.

As Sonic Boom winners, we receive both pre-allocated gems and gems earned by our project during the season.

**We distribute ALL 100% of the received Sonic Gems to our users.**

Gems are distributed depending on the user's earnings in vaults in each of [Yield Contests](https://stability.farm/users), which take place from January 16, 2025 to June 18, 2025.

Gems of the first season are distributed in the wrapper token sGEM1.
