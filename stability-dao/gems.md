# Sonic Gems

> Sonic Gems are developer-focused airdrop points designed to reward apps for driving user engagement and innovation. These Gems can be redeemed for S tokens, which apps can then distribute as rewards to their users.

As Sonic Boom winners, we receive both pre-allocated gems and gems earned by our project during the season.

**We distribute ALL 100% of the received Sonic Gems to our users.**

Gems are distributed depending on the user's earnings in vaults in each of [Yield Contests](https://stability.farm/users), which take place from January 16, 2025 to June 18, 2025. Totally will be minted 10 000 000 sGEM1 in 11 bi-weekly contests.

We distribute Gems of the first season in form of the liquid wrapper token **sGEM1**. sGEM1 can be traded in [sGEM1/scUSD](https://www.shadow.so/stats/0x1adcaaf67307453a3995a7fff78b8cbec1efd00f) CL pool on [Shadow Exchange](https://www.shadow.so/).

In June 2025 holders of sGEM1 be able to swap it on S, when 1st Season ends.
