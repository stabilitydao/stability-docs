# Governance (under construction)

xSTBL stakers with enough power have STBL_DAO common power token. 1 STBL_DAO is 1 staked xSTBL.

## Supreme Governance

Managing DAO parameters via Stability Improvement Proposals (SIP) voting.

### Current parameters

* Minimal power: 4,000
* xSTBL instant exit penalty: 50%
* Proposal threshold: 100,000
* Inter-chain power allocation delay: 1 day

## Inter-chain power

The owner of common power can distribute it between blockchains to manage the liquidity of MetaVaults via voting with bribes.

### In-chain power tokens

* STBL_SONIC
* STBL_AVAX
* STBL_PLASMA

## Managing tokenized agents

An agent is a high-level architectural component of the Stability platform. Some agents (especially those with a high burn rate) require collective governance to operate effectively. Locked agent tokens allow participation in agent governance through a two-stage voting process: voting on a proposal with the agent token and confirming the proposal with the Supreme Governance.
