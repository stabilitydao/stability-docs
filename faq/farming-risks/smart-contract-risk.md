# Smart Contract Risk

Stability engages with multiple external smart contracts, exposing users to risks from both its own contracts and those it connects with outside the platform.

To mitigate risk, each deposit in Stabilityâ€™s farms is kept separate. This means that assets in "risky" farms are shielded from impacting assets in "safe" farms, ensuring that issues in one category do not affect the stability of assets in another.
