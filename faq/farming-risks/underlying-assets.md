# Underlying Assets

Your Assets Under Management (AUM) in Stability are valued in USD, with prices sourced from the Chainlink price feed. AUM is determined by converting the underlying assets in the farm to their current USD value. Consequently, any fluctuations in the value of these assets relative to the US Dollar will affect your AUM.&#x20;

However, it's important to note that auto-compounding continues to add reward tokens to your farm share. Thus, while the USD value of your AUM may decrease, you are still accruing reward tokens and benefiting from Stabilityâ€™s auto-compounding mechanism.
