# Zap

{% hint style="info" %}
Using ZAP, it is imperative to verify your quote diligently. Although ZAP safeguards against market slippage, which refers to the variance in price from the moment an order is placed to the time it is executed, it does not shield you from the price impact. Price impact signifies the extent to which your transaction influences the price of tokens within the liquidity pool. It is generally observed that assets with lower liquidity are more susceptible to significant price impacts.
