# Replenish your wallet

Now that your wallet is set up, it's time to add funds in the form of crypto tokens. Any transaction on a blockchain, be it a trade on a decentralized exchange or a deposit into Stability vault, necessitates the use of the native gas token for processing. For Ethereum transactions, this native token is ETH, and for BSC transactions, it is BNB, etc.

## Centralised Exchange method

Adding funds to your wallet becomes a straightforward task, especially if you possess an account on a centralised exchange like Binance or Coinbase. Essentially, it involves transferring your cryptocurrency from the exchange to your wallet address. During this process, you select the specific coin for withdrawal and designate the blockchain network on which you intend to receive the cryptocurrency asset.
