# MetaVault

A MetaVault is a vault that invests in other vaults. Our implementation has a unique architecture that was developed to automate the management of decentralized finances based on the Stability platform.

## Features

* Safe to use with all Stability vaults (Compounder/MetaVault), any assets
* Rebase stablecoin (pegged to USD, S, ETH, BTC) for fast yield delivery
* Wrapped version to use in DeFi
* ERC4626 single asset wrapper to use in boosted pools

## MetaVault deployments

* Sonic **metaUSD**
  * metaUSDC
  * metascUSD
* Sonic **metaS**
  * metawS
* Avalanche **metaUSDC**
