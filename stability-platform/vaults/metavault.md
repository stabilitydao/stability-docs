# AI-driven MetaVault

MetaVault is an automated portfolio vault / index fund. It strategically allocates holders' funds into a designated set of Compounder vaults with different strategy assets.

## Possible sets

* ETH + LST
* Stablecoins with limited risk score
* Assets for trading
* Token liquidity
* High risk, max yield

## Why AI?

### Rebalance

Rebalancing index fund is an expensive process. The costs are swap fees, gas, and losses due to price fluctuations.

Using machine learning for rebalancing allows this type of vault to work effectively.

### Risk management

Classifying assets by risk for use in MetaVault is a problem that can be effectively solved using machine learning.
