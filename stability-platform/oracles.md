# Oracles

Stability leverages Api3's OEV (Oracle Extractable Value) oracles as its primary price feed solution in some lending markets. Api3 not only provides Stability reliable, price data but also generates additional revenue for the protocol through OEV rewards. By capturing value that would otherwise leak to MEV bots and arbitrageurs, Api3's oracles help maximize protocol efficiency while maintaining robust price accuracy.
